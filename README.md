This repository contains the code for a Newspaper Agency Management System (NAMS). This system was developed to address the need for a comprehensive tracking of redactors assigned to each newspaper in a newspaper agency.
The primary function of this system is to keep track of which redactors are responsible for the publication of each newspaper. This ensures transparency and accountability within the agency.
# Database Structure
NAMS is built on a robust database structure that efficiently stores and retrieves information about the newspapers and their respective redactors.

# Additional Features
An optional feature that can be added to this system is the ability to assign more than one topic to each newspaper. This would allow for a broader range of news coverage and provide readers with a more diverse selection of news.

This project showcases the application of efficient system design and implementation.

Please feel free to explore the code and provide any feedback.
